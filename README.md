## To update your branch from the main branch ( optional ):
1. **Fetch the Latest Changes from Upstream**
  Fetch the latest changes from the upstream main branch:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```
  This will get any new commits from the upstream repository but won't apply them to your branch yet.

2. **Merge Changes from Upstream's main into Your Current Branch**
Now, merge the fetched changes from the upstream main branch into your current branch :
    ```bash
    git merge upstream/main
